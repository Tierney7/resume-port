    "aboutme":"Full-Stack web developer leveraging Art and Management background to build a new, creative, and more intuitive user experience on the web. Recently earned a certificate in full stack development from the University of Kansas, with newly developed skills in HTML, JavaScript, CSS, React.js, and responsive web design to name a few. Along with my studies though the university I have also earned several certificates of completion with Codecademy. Passionate about developing functional and cosmetically pleasing apps, with a focus on mobile design and development. With each project, my goal is to grab my audience's attention with stunning design for a unique user experience. I have applied aspects of several languages for my personal projects, both front and back-end. I’ve contributed to 3 separate group projects. Building everything from a local restaurant review website utilizing API’s, a recipe generator using Handlebars, and a social network designed to help coding students, and professionals stay in touch. I am excited to use these skills, along with my professional background as part of a creative, quality-driven team to build functional, and more unique experiences for internet users. ",
